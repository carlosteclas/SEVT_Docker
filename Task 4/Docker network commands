Copy and paste these commands on your Terminal to experience Docker faster :)

Command 1: Create a docker bridged network which will use 192.168.100.0 as their IPAM network and define 192.168.100.1 as gateway
  docker network create --subnet 192.168.100.0/24 --gateway 192.168.100.1 -d bridge MySEVTNetwork
  
  Hint: docker network inspect will show you the specification for your newly created network

Command 2: Create 2 new containers in detached mode and add them to your recently created network
  docker run -it -d --network MySEVTNetwork --name MyNetworkContainer centos
  docker run -it -d --network MySEVTNetwork --name MyNetworkContainer2 centos
  
Command 3: Check that your containers are now part of the network specification you created
  docker network inspect MySEVTNetwork

Command 4: Log into one of your recently created containers and check connectivity via IP address or name. Verify there is connectivity to the Internet proving NAT is working on your host automatically
  
  docker attach MyNetworkContainer

  Hint: ping MyNetworkContainer2 or ping www.yahoo.com
