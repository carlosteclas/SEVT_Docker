Copy and paste these commands on your Terminal to experience Docker faster :)

Command 1: Create a docker volume

  docker volume create MySEVTVolume

Command 2: List your locally available volumes

  docker volume ls

Command 3: Run a container and mount your recently created volume to it in its /home. Anything you store at /home will be stored persistently in your volume

  docker container run --name MyPVContainer -v MySEVTVolume:/home
  
Command 4 (set of commands): Inside the container, go to /home and create a new directory plus 3 empty files using the command touch. Then exit the container

cd home
ls
mkdir MyDockerDirectory
touch 1
touch 2
touch 3
ls

exit

Command 5: Now, run a new container and mount the same volume to it. The directory and files you created on the previous step should be there

docker container run --name MyPVContainer2 -v MySEVTVolume:/home
cd /home
ls
