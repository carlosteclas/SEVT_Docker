These are the commands I used to show the K8 comparison vs Docker Swarm

Command 1: Runs a deployment which creates a Pod using our sevtweb docker image as the base and uses port 8080

  kubectl run myfirstK8deployment --image=ccampost/sevtweb --port=8080
  
  What happened: K8 searched for a suitable node where an instance of the application could be run, scheduled the app to run on that node and configured the cluster to re-schedule that deployment when needed
