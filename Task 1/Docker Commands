Copy and paste these commands on your Terminal to experience Docker faster :)

Command 1: Create a Centos Container with Interactive mode on a TTY terminal named MySEVTContainer

  docker container run -ti --name MySEVTContainer centos
  
Hint: If you type exit once inside the container, the container stops. If you type the sequence Ctrl+P Ctrl + Q you can exit and keep it running

Command 2: Same container as before but with detached mode (running in the background)
 
 docker container run -ti -d --name MySEVTContainerDetached centos

Hint: You can access that container with the following command
  docker attach MySEVTContainerDetached
  
Command 3: List your active containers (add the -a option if you want to see stopped containers as well)
  docker container ls
